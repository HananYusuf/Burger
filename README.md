# Burger

## Description

This is a full stack application that follows the MVC design pattern. The program allows users to input their choice of burger. Whenever the user submits a burgerâ€™s name the app will display it on the burgers t eat list of the page waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks on the burgers on that list, it will be moved to the devoured burgers list of the page and both created and devoured burgers will be stored in the database.
